# playwright-cucumber-sample

## **Overview:**

This is a sample test automation framework developed using **Playwright** with **Cucumber**.

**Playwright** is a framework for Web Testing and Automation. It allows testing Chromium, Firefox and WebKit with a single API. Playwright is built to enable cross-browser web automation that is ever-green, capable, reliable and fast.

**Cucumber** is a tool for running automated tests written in plain language. Because they're written in plain language, they can be read by anyone on your team. Because they can be read by anyone, you can use them to help improve communication, collaboration and trust on your team. Cucumber supports behavior-driven development. Central to the Cucumber BDD approach is its ordinary language parser called Gherkin. 

For Demo purpose web UI test cases are created on [ecommerce-playground.lambdatest.io](https://ecommerce-playground.lambdatest.io/index.php) site and API test cases are created on these [SOAP Calculator API](http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx) & [REST Library Information System API](https://www.libraryinformationsystem.org/Services/RestService.svc) endpoints.
